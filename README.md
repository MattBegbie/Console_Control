# Console_Control
My script for controling windows with the console. I like to be able to use the keyboard without the mouse, so this makes it easier for some tasks which i do a lot.
 - The main focus of this is to practice consitency in my code and in design. the whole thing should have consistent commands. I dont know why i need to create this, but it seemed necesarry.
 
Features So Far:
 - Music Control
 

To-Do
 - join this with my startup script
 - add copy paste functions
 - add commmon commands i use
